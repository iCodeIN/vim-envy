A work-in-progress, almost no-color light colorscheme for Vim with comfortable contrast.

Intended for both day and night usage with moderate screen brightness.

A "fake-busy" screenshot to give you an idea of some highlights in action.
Colors are used sparingly and mostly for UI-related higlights (search, errors, etc).
